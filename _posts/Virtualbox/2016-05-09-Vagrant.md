*Vagrant template file*

<https://github.com/borisschapira/vagrant-template/blob/master/Vagrantfile>

*Some comments:*

I've just changed actimeo=1 to nolock,vers=3,udp and set compatibility to w8.
It works like a charm! I'm using Windows 10 64 bit.

tcp port 1058 is taken by windows "Policy Agent" service. This service is related to IPSec. net stop PolicyAgent helps

Make sure you edit /etc/nginx/nginx.conf and set "sendfile" to off if using NFS or you will run into weird caching issues.
