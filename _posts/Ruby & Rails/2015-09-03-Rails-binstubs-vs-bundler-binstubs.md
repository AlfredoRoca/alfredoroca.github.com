    bin/rails runner ....

Throws an error about "Permission denied"

Solution: 

    chmod u+x bin/rails

Then, thows this message:

    Looks like your app's ./bin/rails is a stub that was generated by Bundler.

    In Rails 4, your app's bin/ directory contains executables that are versioned
    like any other source code, rather than stubs that are generated on demand.

    Here's how to upgrade:

      bundle config --delete bin    # Turn off Bundler's stub generator
      rake rails:update:bin         # Use the new Rails 4 executables
      git add bin                   # Add bin/ to source control

    You may need to remove bin/ from your .gitignore as well.

    When you install a gem whose executable you want to use in your app,
    generate it and add it to source control:

      bundle binstubs some-gem-name
      git add bin/new-executable


Solution:

    bundle config --delete bin
    rake rails:update_bin
