{% include JB/setup %}

    git checkout A
    git rebase B

Before:

                     A1 -> A2 -> [A]
                    /
    1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4  -> 5 -> 6 -> 7 -> 8[B]

After:

                                          A1' -> A2' -> [A]
                                         /
    1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4  -> 5 -> 6 -> 7 -> 8[B]


Option: rebase to a certain commit, not HEAD

    git rebase 6
                                A1'' -> A2'' -> [A]
                               /
    1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4  -> 5 -> 6 -> 7 -> 8[B]
