Before:

                     A1 -> A2 -> [A]
                    /
    1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4  -> 5 -> 6 -> 7 -> 8[B]
                                        |
                                        master, HEAD

    git checkout A
    git rebase B

After:

                                                        HEAD
                                                        |
                                          A1' -> A2' -> [A]
                                         /
    1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4  -> 5 -> 6 -> 7 -> 8[B]
                                        |
                                        master



To fast-forward merge:

    git checkout B
    git merge A

Finally:

    1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4  -> 5 -> 6 -> 7 -> 8[B] -> A1' -> A2' -> [A]
                                                                |
                                                                master, HEAD


Option: rebase to a certain commit, not HEAD

    git rebase 6
                                A1'' -> A2'' -> [A]
                               /
    1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4  -> 5 -> 6 -> 7 -> 8[B]
