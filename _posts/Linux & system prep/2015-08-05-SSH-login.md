1. Create public and private keys using ssh-key-gen on local-host
2. Add public identity to ssh agent
2. Copy the public key to remote-host using ssh-copy-id
3. Check authorized_keys to check duplicated keys


## Create public and private keys using ssh-key-gen on local-host

    ssh-key-gen

## Add public identity to ssh agent

    ssh-add
    => enter passphrase

## Copy the public key to remote-host using ssh-copy-id

ssh-copy-id appends public key to authorized key on remote host

    ssh-copy-id -i ~/ssh/id_rsa.pub remote-host

## Check authorized_keys file for duplicated entries

    cat ~/.ssh/authorized_keys

## login

    ssh remote-host
